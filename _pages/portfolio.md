<h2>Portfolio Overview</h2>
<p>
I am an M.Sc. student in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Alberta, specializing in robotics, control systems, and machine learning. 
My work focuses on developing real-time estimation and control algorithms for personalized human–robot interaction. 
With over four years of experience, I integrate system identification, optimization, and computer vision techniques to enhance robotic training and user experience.
