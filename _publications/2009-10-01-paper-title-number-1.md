excerpt: 'This study presents a real-time estimation framework for modelling individual motor learning dynamics using system identification methods: Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The results show how these methods can enable adaptive and personalized robotic training, bridging control theory, neuroscience, and rehabilitation robotics.'
